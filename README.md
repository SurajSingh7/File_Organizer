# File_Organizer
●	It is used to perform certain task to the files and directories in your System with the help of terminal.

●	We are having two commands:

●	node filename organize <Path> :-  Given a directory path that contains multiple files which are unorganized(like-Download folder) then it create a directory named Organized Folder and different sub-folders(like- media ,App ,Images etc) inside Organized folder. Then puts all the files to their respective folders on the basis of extenstion(like- .mp3, .mp4, zip, doc etc).
  
●	node filename tree <Path> :- To display tree like Structure. Used recursion to implement tree command.
